# Summary

UD_Georgian-GNC is a treebank based on texts from the Georgian National Corpus, [GNC](https://clarino.uib.no/gnc).

# Introduction

UD_Georgian-GNC is a treebank based on texts from the Georgian National Corpus, [GNC](https://clarino.uib.no/gnc), which is a corpus of written texts from a variety of genres. The sentences are taken from a novel by Chabua Amiredzibi (Data Tutashxia).

The sentences are analysed using a finite state morphological analyser, and Constraint Grammar rules for disambiguation and dependency parsing. Both disambiguation and dependency analyses are corrected manually in a tool specifically developed for that purpose.

# Acknowledgments

The Georgian treebank and the tools used to create it have been developed by Paul Meurer.
